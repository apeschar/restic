Enhancement: Improve reliability of backend operations

Restic now downloads pack files in large chunks instead of using a streaming
download. This prevents failures due to interrupted streams. The `restore`
command now also retries downloading individual blobs that cannot be retrieved.

HTTP requests that become stuck while uploading or download for more than two
minutes. This ensures that stuck requests are retried after a short timeout.
These new request timeouts can temporarily be disabled by setting the
environment variable `RESTIC_FEATURES=http-timeouts=false`. Note that this
feature flag will be removed in the next minor restic version.
